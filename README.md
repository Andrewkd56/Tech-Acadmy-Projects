# H1 Toy Story Store
My first website I built using html and css to style it. It is a basic home page for a made-up toy store. It contains a navbar, a form, images with image containers.

# H1 Academy Cinemas
I built this movie theater homepage with the framework of bootstrap4. It includes a lot of elements such as a jumbotron, navbar, columns, and styling effects.
